# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

**Prerequisites:** Node 18+ with pnpm

**Initial Setup:**
```bash
pnpm install  # Install dependencies across all packages
```

**Development:**
```bash
# Start Next.js UI development server (Web App)
pnpm --filter @cleanshare/ui dev
# or from root
pnpm dev
# Access at: http://localhost:3000

# Start mobile app development server
cd apps/mobile/web && python3 -m http.server 8081 --bind 0.0.0.0
# Access at: http://localhost:8081

# Build all packages (TypeScript compilation) - REQUIRED FIRST
pnpm --filter @cleanshare/core-detect build
pnpm --filter @cleanshare/wasm build
pnpm --filter @cleanshare/native-bridge build

# Build UI for production (currently has SWC issues on ARM64/Android)
# Use development mode for now: pnpm --filter @cleanshare/ui dev

# Run CLI tool for development/testing (when implemented)
# pnpm --filter @cleanshare/cli build && pnpm exec node apps/cli/bin/index.js sanitize ./samples/images
```

**Current Status:** 
- ✅ Web App (localhost:3000): Fully functional with professional UI, OCR detection, sanitization, preview, and download
- ✅ Mobile App (localhost:8081): Fully functional with complete PDF analysis, Tesseract.js OCR, detection, sanitization, and download
- ✅ WASM Workers: Implemented with Tesseract.js OCR and PDF processing
- ✅ Native Bridge: Web fallbacks implemented for all Capacitor plugins
- ✅ PDF Processing: Complete pdf-lib integration for both platforms with proper redaction
- ⚠️ Production Build: ARM64 SWC issues prevent static builds (use dev mode)

- ✅ Mobile App: Fixed PDF redaction using pdf-lib instead of text fallback
- ✅ Cross-Platform: Both platforms now use identical detection logic and produce consistent results

## Architecture

CleanShare Pro is a monorepo for a cross-platform privacy tool that sanitizes images and PDFs by detecting and redacting sensitive information (emails, phone numbers, credit cards, etc.).

### Package Structure

- **`packages/ui`** - Next.js application providing the web/mobile UI
  - Uses React with TypeScript
  - Renders file picker, review canvas, detection overlay, export screen
  - Spawns Web Workers for heavy operations (OCR, PDF parsing) via Comlink
  - Runs in WebView for Capacitor mobile apps

- **`packages/core-detect`** - Platform-agnostic detection and redaction logic
  - Core types: `InputFile`, `Box`, `DetectionKind`, `Detection`, `RedactionStyle`, etc.
  - Pure detector functions for emails, phones, credit cards (Luhn), IBAN (MOD 97), JWT, AWS keys
  - Pipeline orchestrating OCR → token extraction → detection → result construction
  - Redaction drawing on images (Canvas) and PDFs (pdf-lib)

- **`packages/wasm`** - ✅ WebAssembly workers for CPU-intensive tasks
  - Tesseract.js Web Worker with Comlink for improved OCR performance
  - PDF processing worker using pdf-lib for large file handling  
  - Worker manager for easy lifecycle management
  - Full TypeScript compilation and build system

- **`packages/native-bridge`** - ✅ Capacitor plugins with web fallbacks
  - ShareInWeb: File picker fallback with drag-drop support
  - VisionWeb: OCR integration using WASM worker + QR code detection with jsQR
  - PdfToolsWeb: Complete PDF manipulation using pdf-lib worker
  - Seamless Capacitor plugin registration for cross-platform compatibility

### Apps

- **`apps/mobile`** - ✅ Capacitor wrapper for iOS/Android  
  - Mobile-ready HTML/JS interface with Capacitor integration
  - Cross-platform compatibility (works in browser and mobile WebView)
  - Module loading system for all CleanShare packages
  - File processing pipeline integration with demo functionality
  - Ready for native iOS/Android builds

- **`apps/cli`** - Node.js CLI for batch processing
  - Uses `core-detect` and `wasm` packages
  - Useful for automated testing and bulk processing

### Data Flow

1. **File Selection** → JavaScript `File` object passed to pipeline
2. **Analysis** → `analyzeDocument()` uses native OCR or Tesseract.js fallback
3. **User Review** → UI draws bounding boxes, allows redaction customization  
4. **Redaction** → `applyRedactions()` draws boxes on pages, strips metadata
5. **Export** → New sanitized file triggers system share sheet

### Extension Points

- **Additional detectors:** Add to `core-detect/src/detectors` with `detect(token: string)` function
- **Vector PDF redaction:** Can be added to native plugins or WASM layer
- **Cloud assist:** Send only OCR tokens/boxes to remote service, merge with local results

## Workspace Configuration

This is a pnpm workspace with packages defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:
```yaml
packages:
  - "apps/*" 
  - "packages/*"
```

All packages use TypeScript with individual `tsconfig.json` files. The mobile app uses Capacitor 5.x for native bridge functionality.
