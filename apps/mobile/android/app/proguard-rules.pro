# Add project-specific ProGuard rules here if you enable minification.
# The rules in this file are processed by the proguard-android plugin.

# Currently this file is empty because the CleanShare Pro app does not
# enable code shrinking in the release build.  When you enable
# minification, you can add rules to preserve classes and methods
# required by your plugins or libraries.
